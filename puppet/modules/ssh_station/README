Server ---> Client
------------------
* /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub ---> /home/ssh_station/.ssh/known_hosts
server has a fact sshrsakey, passed to clients via exported resource
@@sshkey { "ssh_station_server_$fqdn": alias => $fqdn, type => rsa, key => $sshrsakey, tag => "ssh_station_server_$fqdn" }

Redmine ---> Server

Redmine users paste his dsa public key on redmine, them are passed to server via get_host_definition and used on a ssh_authorized_key puppet type
